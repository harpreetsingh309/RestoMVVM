# Restaurant MVVM
It is a very simple app with MVVM design pattern app to show restaurants list for the particular location "Abbotsford" and in this user can make favourite any restaurant.

Environment:
1. XCODE: 12.2
2. iOS Target: 13.0
3. Swift 5

Features
1. Display the name the restaurantâ€™s featured Image as a background image, a gradient layer, the restaurant name and address.

2. Switch between home listing and favourite list of restaurant.

3. Can use image caching to ensure the images only download once. (SDWebImage Or Kingfisher) 

4. Tapping favourite/unfavourite should toggle the button.

Note:
Developer platform of Zomato is not working, so I munually added mock data into JSON file to show listing.
